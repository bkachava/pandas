# Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib and APIs Assignments

Apply the skills learned so far to some real-world situations.
 
 
## PyCitySchools

Use the Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook for helping a School Board and Mayor to make strategic decisions
regarding future school budgets and priorities, an analysis to the district-wide standardized test results was made. 
Also, data was aggregated to show trends in school performance.


The [final report](PyCitySchools/Scripts/PyCitySchools.ipynb) includes:

- District Summary. A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including: Total Schools, 
Total Students, Total Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and
Overall Passing Rate.

- School Summary. An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including: School Name, School Type
Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, 
% Passing Reading, and Overall Passing Rate.

- Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate). A table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall 
Passing Rate, including: School Name, School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget,
Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and Overall Passing Rate.

- Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate). A table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based 
on Overall Passing Rate, including all of the same metrics as above.

- Math Scores by Grade. A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th,
11th, 12th) at each school.

- Reading Scores by Grade. A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th,
10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

- Scores by School Spending. A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges 
(per Student), with 4 bins to group school spending, including: Average Math Score, Average Reading Score,
% Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and Overall Passing Rate.

- Scores by School Size. Same as above, but group schools are based on an approximation of school size 
(Small, Medium, Large).

- Scores by School Type. Same as above, but group schools are based on school type (Charter vs. District).
